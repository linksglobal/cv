     <p>I started programming April 2021 and its been great so far. I encountered several challenges both the ones that are foreseen and unforeseen, but with my little experience so far i have found out that Coding is more interesting than i ever thought. The technical aspect of it makes it a serious scientific exercise tasking  the brain with several jobs as well as  warranting he need to learn new skills to carry out new tasks as you work on new tye of project. Moreover the most interesting part for me is the Creative part. Whatever your mind conceives your code creates and this serves as the greatest motivation on the journey of programming. </p>
    <p>Got a decent education and the credit goes to my parents of blessed memory; Elder Adeboye Titus and Deaconess Oluwafunke Alice.</p>
    <p>Indeed I love Tech and Engineering for their two most beatiful characteristics viz: Technicality and Creativity.
         Below are the lists of the other things I did before I started coding and still do till date, some at a proffessional level and some in voluntary service to friends and family.
